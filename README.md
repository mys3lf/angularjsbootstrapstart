# AngularJS 1 with Bootstrap


This repository is more or less my startup folder. I use it as a accelerator when I want to start a new website. It comes with the following "features":

 - mini a top navigation
 - header area
 - content navigation
 - content area
 - footer
 
Actually, I uploaded this for me, but feel free to use it & modify it. Just give me some credit and add a link to oforge.de. If you have any questions or need support for your project, you can contact me at musclebeaver@gapsi.de.
